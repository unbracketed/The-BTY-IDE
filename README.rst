The bitty IDE
=============

1. This is not an IDE.
2. bitty (BTY) IDE is more of a suggestion, if anything. 
3. bitty is meant to describe a common protocol for assembling minimal, powerful, portable, cross-platform* development environments based on common commands and tools. 
4. bitty is more like a personal subscription into a long-term plan. Much like learning to play an instrument, BTY is a willingness to commit a very small amount of time on a consistent basis in return for becoming very proficient over time.
5. As this system is intended to be 100% customizable to my workflow, I can confidently say that my development environment is Better Than Yours. 


The goal is to provide more of a protocol for managing config files for various *nix commands and applications.

The target environment is based on tmux and zsh with an emphasis on Python devevelopment.
