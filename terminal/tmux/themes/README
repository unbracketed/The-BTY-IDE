Tips for creating themes:

Use the shortcut to reload the tmux config C-r as you make changes. This way you can quickly verify 
that each individual change has the desired result.


To get a colorized list of tmux color codes run this in a shell:
for i in {0..255} ; do
    printf "\x1b[38;5;${i}mcolour${i}\n"
done
